    "This project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunication company using classification models. We will explore and analyze the provided datasets to gain insights into factors influencing customer retention. The goal is to build machine learning models capable of predicting customer churn and offer valuable insights to the company for strategic decision-making.\n",
